    <h1>Prototypes</h1>
    <p>
      Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its
      prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have
      its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends
      when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
